# Anomaly Detection in IoT Networks

## 🚀 Project Overview
As the Internet of Things (IoT) grows, so does the risk of cyber threats. Our initiative tackles this issue by applying innovative machine learning methods for anomaly detection within IoT networks. Our goal is to strengthen IoT security and protect devices against hostile intrusions by pinpointing irregular network traffic patterns.With a focus on anomaly detection, we strive to bolster network security and lead the way to more secure IoT implementations.

## 🔍 What You’ll Find Here

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Discover hidden patterns and insights in the data, including traffic distributions and correlations among features.

Data Processing Techniques: Learn how we handle outliers, normalize data, and address class imbalance to prepare the dataset for modeling.

Feature Engineering: Dive into the methods used to refine our feature set, including PCA, Random Forest for feature importance, and Chi-Squared testing.

Model Selection and Evaluation: Explore the performance of four machine learning models—KNN, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest—with detailed accuracy metrics and insights.

Deployment: Understand how we built a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with our model in real-time.
